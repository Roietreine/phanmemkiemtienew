                    <p>The internet has provided us with more ways to make money than we’ve ever had
                        in the past. It seems like almost every day, a new app or website is created
                        with the sole purpose of helping us make or save more money in creative
                        ways.</p>
                    <p>Plus, the old-fashioned ways are still around too – there’s no shame in
                        making some extra cash by babysitting, holding a garage sale, or doing some
                        odd jobs for your neighbors.</p>
                    <p>Whatever your schedule and whatever your skills, there’s bound to be
                        something you can do to make money without pursuing a conventional job
                        route.

                        putting in a few spare minutes every day can add up to a respectable amount

                        entry</a> is another job option that isn’t overly lucrative, but if you want
                        an easy way to make some money easily in a non-stressful way then it could
                        be something you consider. However, data entry appeals to lots of people so
                        the jobs can be competitive. Axion Data Services, DionData Solutions, and
                        DataPlus+ are three of employers that regularly hire data entry clerks.</p>

                    <p>Transcription is similar to data entry, but instead of converting data from
                        one source to another, you’ll be converting audio files into text. It’s
                        therefore essential to be able to type quickly and accurately. Some websites
                        that hire transcriptionists are <a href="https://scribie.com/"
                                                           target="_blank"
                                                           rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Scribie</a>,

                        money at the start, but you’ll increase your earning power when you learn to

                    <h3 id="6">6. Virtual / Personal Assistant</h3>
                    <p>As a <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/how-to-become-virtual-assistant/">virtual
                        assistant</a>, you’ll be completing all kinds of tasks for a company or
                        individual that can be carried out online. It’s a good option if you want to
                        be doing a wider variety of work without high barriers to entry. Possible
                        tasks include scheduling, customer support, and administration.</p>

                    <h3 id="7">7. Virtual Receptionist</h3>
                    <p>There’s some overlap between a virtual assistant and a virtual receptionist,
                        but a receptionist focuses solely on answering phone calls and completing
                        basic administration tasks. If you have a computer and a phone, you can
                        easily carry out the work at home, so various companies are starting to hire
                        virtual receptionists including Smith.ai.</p>
                    <h3 id="8">8. Customer Service Agent</h3>
                    <p>Customer service agents carry out similar work to virtual receptionists: both
                        roles revolving around phone calls with customers. The main difference is
                        that you’ll be helping customers with their queries instead of booking
                        appointments. Hilton, Apple, and Amazon are amongst the companies looking
                        for customer service reps.</p>
                    <h3 id="9">9. Store Peoples Stuff</h3>
                    <p>You have space in your home or garage that sits empty, why not <a

                        money from it</a>? It can be the size of a closet or a spare room or an
                        outdoor shed. Fortunately there is a service that makes this very easy. In
                        New York City, they estimate a spare basement rental to generate almost
                        $10,000 per year!</p>
                    <p>Neighbor’s Host Guarantee protects you up to $1,000,000 for personal
                        liability and renter’s are eligible for up to $25,000 in case items are

                    <p>If you have some technical knowledge, you could specialize in helping
                        customers solve their problems with technology instead. This could involve
                        chatting to people who are struggling to use a web page or who have faulty
                        software and helping them to troubleshoot.</p>
                    <h3 id="11">11. Virtual Travel Agent</h3>
                    <p>Anyone who enjoys customer service and you have a passion for travel could
                        consider becoming a virtual travel agent to merge those two interests
                        together. Travel agencies used to be physical entities, but since the
                        service focuses on a simple conversation it’s become more popular and
                        convenient for this to take place digitally. Travel Planners International,
                        Nexion, and Avoya all hire virtual travel agents.</p>
                    <h3 id="12">12. Dropshipping</h3>
                    <p>Dropshipping allows you to sell goods without ever having to hold a physical
                        inventory of your products. A third party like Shopify will store and
                        deliver the stock for you at the price of taking a commission. Your role is
                        to list the items on your website at a price large enough for you to be able
                        to make a profit after commission.</p>
                    <h3 id="13">13. Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA)</h3>
                    <p>The FBA scheme is Amazon’s solution to dropshipping. You’ll have to find the
                        stock you want initially, but you can then ship everything straight to
                        Amazon and receive reimbursement instead of handling your own inventory
                        until the items sell. You’ll make slightly less than if you sold the items
                        directly since Amazon take some commission, but the scheme makes it possible
                        to sell more items without worrying about holding too much inventory. It can
                        be especially profitable if you buy goods from discounted stores then go on
                        to sell them for a higher price.</p>
                    <h3 id="14">14. Consignor</h3>
                    <p>A consignor collects unwanted possessions and pays their owners when
                        customers pay them, making a profit from the commission charged. This could
                        be a viable option if you have friends and family with lots of unwanted
                        possessions but no time to sell them themselves. However, it can be
                        difficult to scale up beyond close connections as the people who consign
                        goods to you will need to trust you.</p>

                    <h3 id="15">15. Flip Items from Flea Markets</h3>
                    <p>If you enjoy bargain-hunting, you could make money from finding undersold
                        items in flea markets that could be sold for a larger amount elsewhere to
                        make a profit. You’ll need an information advantage to make money, so it’s
                        best to focus on a particular asset class you’re knowledgeable about. Bear
                        in mind that attending flea markets can take a lot of time and there’s no
                        guarantee of making a profit, but if it’s something you enjoy you could make
                        money this way.</p>
                    <h3 id="16">16. Domain Selling</h3>
                    <p>Having a good domain is an essential part of <a
                            href="https://millennialmoney.com/online-business-ideas/">starting a
                        successful online business</a>, and many people are willing to pay a high
                        price to have the domain they’ve set their hearts on. It’s possible to
                        capitalize on this by buying domains for a low price that you think could be
                        sold at a higher price later down the road. The problem is that it may take
                        a while to be able to sell a domain you buy, so patience is key.</p>
                    <h3 id="17">17. Etsy Store Owner</h3>
                    <p>If you have the creativity and ability to make your own items, Etsy is a
                        great place to go to sell them. You could <a
                                href="https://millennialmoney.com/sell-jewelry-online/">sell
                            jewelry</a>, clothing, paintings, or anything; many people specialize in
                        customized items or unofficial memorabilia that can’t be found anywhere else
                        on the web. As long as you can get the raw materials for a low price and
                        counter in the costs of shipping, it’s possible to make a significant
                        profit.</p>
                    <h3 id="18">18. eBay Shop</h3>
                    <p>eBay is one of the oldest active websites on the web, but it’s still as
                        popular as ever, with millions of active users. Whatever you’re hoping to
                        sell, there’s probably a market for it on eBay. Start off by selling your
                        unwanted possessions, and once you get the hang of things you could move on
                        to reselling items you find at discounted prices in stores or at flea
                        markets.</p>
                    <h3 id="19">19. Sell Email & Media Kit Templates</h3>
                    <p>Email and media kit templates are in high demand as they’re an essential part
                        of marketing. Why not sell your own? <a

                            a blog</a> or website focused on email and media kits and include plenty
                        of links and references to your own kits. If you can rank highly in Google
                        for the right keywords then you’re bound to sell a lot, but this is no easy
                        task.</p>
                    <h3 id="20">20. Sell Your Textbooks</h3>
                    <p>Anyone who used to be a student – or who still is – probably has a lot of
                        textbooks lying around. It can be difficult to figure out where to sell them
                        for the highest profit, but <a

                    <p>Lots of people have old possessions they don’t use lying around their house;

                    <h3 id="22">22. Forex Trader</h3>
                    <p>Some people make money by trading on the foreign exchange market; by buying
                        one currency while it’s at a low then selling it once it’s worth more, you
                        can make a profit. Of course, this is a risky practice unless you know what
                        you’re doing and you’re prepared to hold an inventory of different
                        currencies.</p>
                    <h3 id="23">23. Cryptocurrency Trader</h3>
                    <p>Similarly, some people manage to make money by trading cryptocurrencies using
                        the same principle. Cryptocurrencies are more volatile than foreign
                        currencies so, whilst it’s possible to make higher profits, it’s more likely
                        that you’ll lose big too. Only try if you’re knowledgeable about
                        currencies.</p>
                    <h3 id="24">24. Graphic Designer</h3>
                    <p>Graphic design work is always in high demand on the internet. Whether it’s
                        logos, posters or other visuals, graphics are a key part of creating a brand
                        and a marketing strategy. If you know your way around Adobe Creative Cloud
                        or other professional software, you can make a steady side income by doing
                        graphic design for companies. Even if you’re not familiar with any
                        professional graphic design service, you can still make some money by
                        learning to create basic visuals on <a

                    <h3 id="25">25. Bookkeeper / Accountant / Budgeter</h3>
                    <p>If you’re organized and good with numbers, you could consider taking up
                        bookkeeping. It’s a service all businesses need when it comes to filing for
                        taxes, and many small businesses or ‘solopreneurs’ need to outsource the
                        service. The most successful freelance bookkeepers are those that have a
                        history in the industry before freelancing as they already have a client
                        base built up, but if you have a professional network from a different
                        career you could leverage it to start budgeting.</p>
                    <h3 id="26">26. Photographer</h3>
                    <p>The value of photos is at an all-time high in today’s society. Whether it’s
                        an engagement, pregnancy or marriage, many people are demanding professional
                        photography to mark the occasion. If you have the equipment and skills to
                        provide this service, you could pitch yourself as a freelance photographer.
                        When you’re starting out clients may expect you to offer your work for free,
                        especially if you know them personally, so be prepared to stand your ground.
                        You can also make a side income from selling stock photography on websites
                        like <a href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/shutterstock/" target="_blank"

                    <h3 id="27">27. Web Developer</h3>
                    <p>Web developers are front-end developers that use languages such as HTML, CSS,
                        and Javascript to create pages for websites. They also need to optimize
                        website performance.</p>
                    <h3 id="28">28. Web Designer</h3>
                    <p>Many people offer services in both web development and web design as a
                        package, but it’s also possible to offer them separately. If your coding
                        knowledge is limited but you understand what a website needs and have good
                        design skills, you could still be a web designer. Most web designers have
                        some technical knowledge, but if you’d prefer to avoid this you can master a
                        drag and drop software such as Squarespace or Wix instead. Many companies
                        are happy with basic websites made like this as it cuts down on costs.</p>
                    <h3 id="29">29. Voiceover Artist</h3>
                    <p>Every audiobook, advert with a narrator and telephone greeting was narrated
                        using a voiceover artist; this is a huge industry. If you’ve ever been
                        complimented for having a nice or interesting voice, you could think about
                        giving it a go. You can choose whether to be a freelancer or to sell your
                        services through a website set up specifically to connect voiceover artists
                        with clients. Some of the popular ones are <a href="https://voicebunny.com/"

                        and many companies are setting up their own YouTube channels. Anyone who

                    <p>You might think that carrying out research using the internet is a basic
                        skill, but it can be time-consuming so many companies prefer to outsource

                    <h3 id="32">32. Translation</h3>
                    <p>In a globalized world, many businesses are looking to reach people from
                        different regions who speak different languages. If you’re bilingual or even
                        multilingual, you can use your language skills to help companies translate
                        their content. The general recommendation is to only translate from your
                        second language(s) into your native tongue, so it’s often more profitable to
                        translate from another language into English than vice versa.</p>
                    <h3 id="33">33. Blogging</h3>
                    <p>Is there a subject or topic you’re extremely knowledgeable about and enjoy
                        enough to be able to write on it every day for years? If the answer to this
                        question is yes, then <a

                        visitors and readers, but once you do it’s impossible to make significant
                        sums of money. Through blogging you can make money from places adverts on
                        your blog, placing affiliate links in your articles, selling digital
                        products (like online courses), and selling services (like coaching).</p>
                    <h3 id="34">34. Content Writer</h3>
                    <p>Content writers focus on writing blogs, articles and other types of web
                        content. This helps businesses to formulate a content marketing strategy and
                        make their websites more appealing to search engines to gain leads. If you’d
                        like to start a blog, it could be worth taking up content writing jobs on
                        the side whilst waiting for your blog to gain traction. As well as the usual
                        freelancing websites mentioned, you can find work on job boards specifically

                        fields is quite distinct. Copywriters focus directly on selling a company’s
                        product or service; they write content for sales emails, adverts and landing
                        pages that encourages potential customers to take action. Content writers
                        only help to sell indirectly, as they’re focused on creating leads rather
                        than converting those leads. You can find potential clients on freelancing
                        sites or through contacting companies in your niche directly by email or
                        LinkedIn.</p>
                    <h3 id="36">36. Technical Writer</h3>
                    <p>Not everyone with a background in coding, developing or IT services wants to
                        continue working directly in the field. Instead, you can forge a career as a
                        freelance technical writer by writing about software instead of using it
                        yourself. Technical writers help create content like user guides, product
                        manuals, whitepapers, and other technical documentation.</p>
                    <h3 id="37">37. eBook Publisher</h3>
                    <p>It’s more lucrative to self-publish your book and sell it on Amazon than to
                        go the traditional publishing route as Amazon will take less commission. If
                        you sell hundreds of copies within your first week, Amazon will do the rest
                        of the marketing for you, so lowering your price initially could be a
                        worthwhile investment if it attracts more customers. However, as a
                        self-publisher, you’ll need to learn how to format your eBook correctly
                        rather than just uploading it straight into the Amazon mobi generator, and
                        you’ll also need to source a front cover design.</p>
                    <h3 id="38">38. Ghostwriter</h3>
                    <p>When people or companies want to publish a piece of writing but don’t have
                        the time to craft the piece themselves, they hire a ghostwriter to do it for
                        them. This means that you won’t get credit for the pieces you write, but you
                        can often make more money than you would do otherwise. Ghostwriters are
                        needed for all kinds of content, but it’s most commonly eBooks or blog
                        posts.</p>
                    <h3 id="39">39. Medium</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank"
                          rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Medium</a> gives bloggers access to a
                        ready-made audience if they write content for the platform. Anyone can
                        publish an article for free and receive money depending on the time people
                        spend reading their work; if you’re willing to put the time into building up
                        an audience, you can reach the point of earning thousands a month. You can
                        also use Medium to build up a portfolio for other writing jobs or publish
                        the same content on your blog.<br>

                        everyone is brave enough to rent out their whole house to a stranger, but
                        even renting out the spare room can provide a big source of extra income.
                        You might meet some interesting people and end up enjoying it.</p>
                    <h3 id="41">41. Proofreading</h3>
                    <p>For anyone who prides themselves on their spelling and grammar skills,
                        proofreading could be a viable career option. Reading a text for errors
                        might sound straightforward, but it can be hard to muster the concentration
                        to spot small mistakes in a large piece of writing. As well as the usual
                        freelancing sites, check JournalismJobs and MediaBistro for jobs.</p>

                    <h3 id="42">42. Editing</h3>
                    <p>Many people get confused between editing and proofreading; there are
                        definitely similarities between the two, but they’re slightly different.
                        Whilst proofreaders read through a finished piece and check there are no
                        spelling or grammar errors, editors can also change the structure and
                        direction of a piece. For instance, editors could suggest cutting out an
                        entire paragraph or restructuring sentences to create a richer narrative.
                        However, the exact demands depend on the employers and some may demand more
                        than others; sometimes a college degree in English is necessary.</p>
                    <h3 id="43">43. Create a Niche Website</h3>
                    <p>If you’re good at marketing and able to rank highly on Google, you could make
                        a significant amount of money by creating a niche website. Fill your content
                        with landing pages related to your niche that contain products such as
                        online courses with affiliate links; everybody somebody buys a product
                        through one of your links, you’ll receive a commission. It’s important to
                        choose a profitable niche, so do your research first; some of the most
                        popular niches include dating, <a
                                href="https://millennialmoney.com/online-jobs/">making money
                            online</a>, and dieting.</p>
                    <h3 id="44">44. Lead Generation</h3>
                    <p>Lead generation focuses on attracting potential customers and converting them
                        into real clients. There are links with advertising and marketing, but the
                        key difference is lead generators not only try to attract clients but they
                        actively convert them too. You can do this by using calls to action from
                        blog posts, surveys, free coupons or other methods to get customer details
                        then sending them information about the company.</p>
                    <h3 id="45">45. Digital Advertising</h3>
                    <p>Most companies are aware that advertising is important but find formulating a
                        campaign to be a minefield. The best websites to advertise on, like
                        Facebook, change their algorithms and services too often for companies to
                        keep up; this causes added confusion. If you know how Facebook and Instagram
                        ads work and can run PPC (pay-per-click) campaigns on Google, your knowledge
                        might be more valuable than you realize. Contact small businesses with a
                        minimal online presence and help them establish one by running an online
                        advertising campaign.</p>
                    <h3 id="46">46. Social Media Management</h3>
                    <p>Using social media effectively may be second nature to most Millennials and
                        Gen Z-ers, but lots of companies struggle with maintaining active accounts.
                        Even individuals who feel confident with using the socials might find it too
                        time-consuming to actively grow their profile and outsource this job. Social
                        media managers reply to messages, post regularly and interact with other
                        users to grow their follower bases.</p>
                    <h3 id="47">47. Marketing Automation</h3>
                    <p>Another vital element of marketing and advertising is starting an effective
                        email marketing strategy, which helps to retain customers and convert leads.
                        Even if you don’t feel confident with using marketing automation software
                        now, most services provide free resources and are reasonably straightforward
                        to learn; once you become confident, it’s easy to position yourself as an
                        expert. Some of the most popular marketing automation services are Hubspot,
                        Convertkit, and Mailchimp.<br>

                    <h3 id="48">48. SEO Optimization</h3>
                    <p>It’s very important for online businesses to rank highly in Google in order
                        to receive the most page views and therefore clients, yet small businesses
                        especially don’t realize that best practices must be implemented to rank
                        well. Because of this, you’ll find you’re working from a blank slate, so
                        once you learn the basics of search engine optimization you can make a huge
                        difference to how websites perform.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3 id="49">49. Online Fundraising & Grant Writing</h3>
                    <p>The single biggest factor for a business to consider is where their money is
                        coming from, and lots of them rely on funding; not only social enterprises
                        and charities but also companies with pioneering technology. Online
                        fundraising is about working with clients for them to find prospective
                        donors, promote the business, and get more funding. This is a more social
                        role that you may not always be able to do digitally. Grant writing involves
                        writing applications for big funding opportunities, so it can easily be
                        carried out online.</p>
                    <h3 id="50">50. YouTuber</h3>
                    <p>YouTube allows creators to become partners and to <a
                            href="https://millennialmoney.com/how-much-do-youtubers-make/">earn ad
                        revenue from their videos</a> if they get a lot of views and watch time. The
                        website is definitely past the early adapters stage; it’s becoming
                        increasingly competitive to stand out as a new video creator. Nonetheless,
                        if you’re passionate about making videos and consistently putting out
                        high-quality content then the algorithm will work in your favor eventually.
                        Instead of relying solely on ad revenue, you can set up a Patreon account to
                        supplement your income until you get more subscribers.</p>
                    <h3 id="51">51. Podcaster</h3>
                    <p>Lots of YouTubers use the audio content from their videos for podcasts too,
                        which allows them to tap into a larger audience. You could also be a
                        podcaster without starting a YouTube channel; certain types of content work
                        particularly well for podcasts, such as interviews. Remember to make your
                        content available on both Apple and Android devices, as well as Spotify,
                        which is now optimized for podcasts.</p>
                    <p>Podcasting is relatively easy when working with a podcast host like Podbean
                        (the one I use!) to monetize your podcast. This is because Podbean has a
                        feature that you can sign up for free that lets them place small ads before
                        and after your podcast.</p>
                    <h3 id="52">52. Instagram</h3>
                    <p>If you can grow your Instagram account to the point of having thousands of
                        subscribers, it’s possible to monetize your account. Many brands look for
                        Instagram influencers within their space to post adverts for their products;
                        you could make thousands of dollars for a single post. It’s also possible to
                        make money by including affiliate links in your posts. But retaining the
                        trust of your followers is important, so don’t go overboard with the
                        adverts.</p>
                    <h3 id="53">53. Monetize an Email Newsletter</h3>
                    <p>Whereas most email newsletter services charge you money for having a large
                        number of subscribers, <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank"
                                                  rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Substack</a>
                        makes it possible to monetize your newsletter instead. Of course, you need
                        to create content worth paying for, which is difficult in a world where so
                        much written content is available for free on the internet. If you model
                        your newsletter as a kind of email course or you have a following from
                        elsewhere that you transfer, it could be easier to find paying subscribers.
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="54">54. English Teaching</h3>
                    <p>If you’re a native English speaker, why not put your language skills to good
                        use by passing them on to others? Don’t worry if you don’t have any teaching
                        experience; most websites will provide you with the lesson plans. There are
                        a few different platforms you can choose from depending on the type of
                        students you’d prefer to have. <a href="https://www.italki.com/"

                        credentials the higher the rate you’ll be able to charge, but anyone with an
                        academic background can become a tutor. Chegg facilitates online tutoring in
                        a variety of subjects via video call, with a similar format to the English
                        teaching websites. Studypool focuses on homework help: students post
                        questions they need help with and offer a price for the answer, which will
                        vary depending on time and difficulty. All help is submitted via written
                        answers. Qualified teachers can take online gigs using GigEd.</p>
                    <h3 id="56">56. Course Creator</h3>
                    <p>It’s possible to make a passive income from teaching by creating an online
                        course. This requires a large time investment initially and it can be
                        difficult to market your course, but once it’s made you can keep on earning.
                        Two of the most popular course creation websites are Udemy and Coursera. The
                        former focuses on technological skills like coding (amongst other subjects),
                        whilst the latter offers a much broader range of skills, from languages to
                        piano playing.</p>
                    <h3 id="57">57. Test Scoring</h3>
                    <p>You might complain about the number of tests school students are forced to
                        complete throughout the academic year, but the good news is that you can
                        make some extra money by marking their work. Lots of marking assignments are
                        outsourced since teachers have enough on their plates. This is a seasonal
                        job, so you can’t rely on it throughout the year, but it’s a good source of
                        income when it comes around. Some websites to look for gigs include <a

                    <h3 id="58">58. College Consultancy</h3>
                    <p>Teaching and marking aren’t the only side gigs available in the education
                        industry. If you have a stellar academic background and attended a
                        competitive college, you could carve out success as a college consultant.
                        This will involve helping prospective students with their applications and
                        reading through their essays, so you’ll also need strong writing skills to
                        do a good job. The rates for this kind of work can be surprisingly high and
                        go up to $100 an hour.</p>
                    <h3 id="5">59. Scoping</h3>
                    <p>Scoping is a type of transcription especially for courts that involves
                        turning shorthand from court reports into legible writing. The earning
                        potential is greater than that of standard transcription.</p>
                    <h3 id="60">60. Uber Driver</h3>
                    <p>Another gig economy staple is Uber. The company may be facing trouble for not
                        securing its drivers’ rights, but if all you’re looking for is to work for a
                        few hours a week with a flexible schedule then Uber is a good bet. You’ll be
                        able to choose exactly when to work and how often you work, and if you enjoy
                        driving and talking to new people then it could be a fun job for you.</p>
                    <h3 id="61">61. Deliver Fast Food</h3>
                    <p>Maybe the prospect of driving strangers around is too daunting to you, but
                        delivering food sounds more manageable. In that case, you could join the
                        ranks of gig economy workers who deliver food from popular restaurants, like
                        PostMates and Doordash. You can choose whether you want to deliver by <a

                    <p>When it comes to deciding whether to be a stay-at-home parent or to find a
                        job, many people decide that the cost of daycare is larger than their
                        salary, so it’s best to stay at home. But why not have the best of both
                        worlds by making money from looking after other peoples’ children whilst you
                        stay at home with your own. If you feel unsure about how to start a daycare
                        business, you can take <a

                    <h3 id="63">63. Laundry Business</h3>
                    <p>Another business anyone can easily do from home is laundry; assuming you
                        clean your own clothes, you already have the facilities so there’s no extra
                        expense. It might not appeal to you if you can barely stand to do your own
                        laundry, but you’d be hard-pressed to find a more convenient business idea –
                        you could even charge extra for ironing the clothes. By using the Laundry
                        Care app, you’ll be matched with potential clients in the local area without
                        any work on your behalf.</p>
                    <h3 id="64">64. Baby Equipment Rental</h3>
                    <p>If you have children and their old baby gear is still lying around the house,
                        you could make an extra buck from renting it out to local tourists. Babyquip
                        is a website that connects holidaymakers who have children with locals who
                        can supply them with the equipment they need. The only drawback is that you
                        need to live in a popular tourist destination to attract any customers.</p>
                    <h3 id="65">65. Dog Walking</h3>
                    <p>Getting paid to walk dogs might sound like a dream come true for a lot of
                        people, but it’s possible to make some money by doing it. Many dog owners
                        don’t always have the time to walk their own dogs, or they may need some
                        extra help whilst they go on holiday. <a
                                href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/rover/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">Rover</a> is an app
                        that lets you set your prices and offer additional services like doggy

                    <h3 id="66">66. Become A Grocery Shopper</h3>
                    <p>Many people are physically unable or too busy to go grocery shopping for
                        themselves and would prefer to outsource this basic task to those who have
                        the time. If you fall into the latter category, you can become a grocery
                        shopper on <a href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/instacart/"
                                      target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">Instacart</a>.
                        It might not be the most exciting job in the world, but it’s a nice and easy
                        way to make money.</p>
                    <h3 id="67">67. Rent Out Your Car</h3>
                    <p>Most of us only use our car when we need to drive somewhere, and the rest of
                        the time it gets left on the driveway. You can rent out your house on AirBnb
                        – why not rent out your car when you’re not using it too? <a
                                href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/getaround/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">GetAround</a> allows
                        you to do just that; you can choose your own rate and you’ll be covered with
                        liability insurance, so there’s no risk involved.</p>
                    <h3 id="68">68. Rent Out Your Parking Spot</h3>
                    <p>Whilst you’re at it, you can rent out your parking spot too; this can be
                        quite lucrative if you live in a busy area. Try making a listing on a
                        Craigslist and see if anyone takes you up on the offer. However, you’ll need
                        to check the terms of your rental agreement or homeowners association first
                        to check you’re not breaking any rules.</p>
                    <h3 id="69">69. Rent Out Belongings</h3>
                    <p>It’s not just your house, your car, and your baby equipment you can rent out
                        on the gig economy – you can rent out anything that you want if you can find
                        a customer. Fat Llama lets you list any belongings, but the focus is on
                        specialist equipment like DSLR cameras or DJ sets. You’ll also get
                        comprehensive insurance included, so you don’t have to worry about your
                        belongings being robbed.</p>
                    <h3 id="70">70. Babysit</h3>
                    <p>Babysitting is a classic job for teenagers to bring in a little extra pocket
                        money, but that doesn’t mean you can’t do it too. Even if you don’t have any
                        friends or family with children you can babysit for, the gig economy is here
                        to bring you together with people who need babysitters. <a

                    <p>Event staffing is a great job for people who like to be out and about; you’ll
                        get paid for working at events like festivals, music gigs, and fairs. <a
                                href="https://www.snagajob.com/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">SnagAJob</a> is a good job
                        marketplace for finding this type of work, but you’ll also be able to find
                        more conventional job contracts in your area.</p>
                    <h3 id="72">72. Chat Agent</h3>
                    <p>Although customer service agents who talk to customers by phone are still in
                        demand, many companies are moving their customer service to chat boxes
                        instead. The Chatshop and SiteStaff both regularly hire chat agents, but be
                        aware that most companies will only pay you for the time you spend chatting
                        with customers.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3 id="73">73. Find Odd Jobs on Craigslist</h3>
                    <p>Some people get nervous at the prospect of using Craigslist to look for work,
                        but it’s almost always a safe experience. People post all kinds of job
                        adverts on Craigslist, whether that’s long-term freelance work, a
                        conventional contract or a one-off cleaning job. A bonus is that you don’t
                        need to worry about the normal worries of the gig economy – like bad reviews
                        and commission being taken – since Craigslist doesn’t operate in that
                        way.</p>
                    <h3 id="74">74. Do Chores for People</h3>
                    <p>An alternative to Craigslist is <a
                            href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/taskrabbit/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">TaskRabbit</a>, but the
                        outcome is much the same. TaskRabbit matches ‘taskers’ with people who need
                        things to be done. The site has a heavy focus on DIY and manual labor tasks,
                        such as mounting a TV or assembling a desk – but there are also more basic
                        jobs such as cleaning. You’ll set your rate and schedule, then people can
                        book your services through the app.</p>
                    <h3 id="75">75. Be a Line Sitter</h3>
                    <p>Imagine getting paid for standing still and doing nothing. That’s basically
                        the job that <a href="https://www.sameolelinedudes.com/" target="_blank"
                                        rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Same Old Lines Dudes</a>
                        offer; they solve the problem of long queues for new products and tickets by
                        pairing those who have more time than money with those who have more money
                        than time. Unfortunately, the app is limited to New York.</p>
                    <h3 id="76">76. Sell Your Friendship</h3>
                    <p>Just when you thought there was nothing else that the gig economy could help
                        you to rent out, you were wrong: you can even rent out your friendship on <a
                                href="https://rentafriend.com/" target="_blank"

                        sad, but go into the experience with an open mind and see what happens. Some
                        people also have legitimate reasons for needing someone to accompany them to
                        a wedding or social occasion at the last minute.</p>
                    <h3 id="77">77. Social Media Consultancy</h3>
                    <p>If you’re a social media whizz, you could go beyond a social media management
                        gig and form a consultancy. Consultants are generally perceived as being
                        credible, and starting a consultancy gives you the opportunity to expand
                        into a business with employees rather than being a one-man show. As well as
                        helping companies to manage their social accounts, you can give them advice
                        on how to form a long-term social media strategy.</p>
                    <h3 id="78">78. SEO Consulting</h3>
                    <p>Again, if you’re knowledgeable about SEO, you’d be better off starting an SEO
                        consultancy rather than being a freelance search engine optimizer. This
                        definitely brings more responsibility as companies will expect a higher
                        standard, but if you’ve already built up experience then you should be
                        ready. SEO consultants help with editing metadata tags, creating a content
                        marketing strategy, and finding the relevant keywords for a certain topic or
                        niche. My favorite tool: <a href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/sem-rush/"

                    <h3 id="79">79. Cybersecurity and IT</h3>
                    <p>For those who come from an IT background but don’t want a technical role
                        anymore, it could be worth launching a career as an IT consultant instead.
                        You could end up evaluating systems, running tests, and giving advice to
                        organizations about how to manage their technology. A popular niche within
                        IT is cybersecurity due to the number of risks many companies perceive.</p>
                    <h3 id="80">80. PR Consulting</h3>
                    <p>People sometimes get mixed up between advertising, social media, and public
                        relations. There is some overlap since PR professionals also deal with
                        social media, but the main focus is on press releases, campaigns, and public
                        image. To see success, you’ll need strong interpersonal skills for talking
                        on the phones and great organization.</p>
                    <h3 id="81">81. Recruitment Consultancy</h3>
                    <p>You can now run a recruitment consultancy online since all the key aspects of
                        recruitment can be made digital: candidates simply need to upload their CV
                        and you can match them with employers then conduct interviews by phone. Many
                        modern recruitment agencies are operating completely online and contacting
                        candidates by text to keep them informed about the job process. You’ll need
                        to put in long hours to make a recruitment consultancy work, but commissions
                        can be high if you match the right candidates to the right roles.</p>
                    <h3 id="82">82. Life Coaching</h3>
                    <p>The life coach industry seems to be exploding recently, and the earning
                        potential can be huge. Since life coaching isn’t a traditional career path,
                        there’s no established route to take or rate to charge – the only limitation
                        is that you’ll need a certificate to register. Since ‘life coaching’ is such
                        a vague term, it can be helpful to choose a particular niche to specialize
                        in, such as relationships or health. Some of these niches are separate
                        coaching roles in their own right.</p>
                    <h3 id="83">83. Career Coaching</h3>
                    <p>If you’ve done well in your own career, why not coach others about how to do
                        the same? Many people are starting to understand the importance of investing
                        in themselves to see bigger returns in the future by unleashing their
                        potential, and one of the most popular ways to do this is by hiring a career
                        coach. Tasks involve helping clients to prepare for interviews, checking
                        resumes, and offering general guidance about career direction. The further
                        you climbed the ladder in your own career, the more you’ll be able to charge
                        for your services.</p>
                    <h3 id="84">84. Business Coaching</h3>
                    <p>Similarly, if you’ve achieved previous success in the world of
                        entrepreneurialism, your services could be of use to budding entrepreneurs
                        or even established entrepreneurs who want to take their company to the next
                        level. Business coaching is particularly high-stakes; someone is paying you
                        to give them advice, and if your advice goes wrong it could have potentially
                        disastrous consequences. However, if you ‘re confident enough in your
                        abilities for that not to bother you, give it a go.</p>
                    <h3 id="85">85. Meal Planning</h3>
                    <p>You don’t need to be a nutritionist or dietician to be able to plan meals –
                        although it would definitely help! Lots of people who are too busy with work
                        to cook simply need some creativity and inspiration to know what to cook, so
                        if that’s something you’re good at you might be able to help others more
                        than you realize.</p>
                    <h3 id="86">86. Interior Design Consulting</h3>
                    <p>Many people think they’re a dab hand at designing their own homes – are you
                        confident enough in your abilities to offer your services to others too? It
                        can be difficult to get started at interior design consulting since it’s
                        heavily testimonial-based, but you could start by helping your friends out
                        and hope for referrals.</p>
                    <h3 id="87">87. Designer</h3>
                    <p>You no longer need to be talent-spotted by a fancy company or invest in your
                        own professional equipment to become a designer. Now you can upload your
                        designs straight onto clothes, thanks to websites like <a

                        upload your designs on to everything from phone cases to framed prints to
                        T-shirts; for many people, this is more accessible than starting an Etsy
                        shop straightaway and can act as a useful stepping stone to test market
                        demand.</p>

                    <h3 id="88">88. App Developer</h3>
                    <p>Whilst it’s possible to make money developing apps for other companies, you
                        can make even more by developing your own apps. This is a long and difficult
                        process; it can also be fairly risky as you won’t be able to gauge customer
                        interest until the product is already finished. However, if you can find
                        active users and monetize your app (through purchases or adverts), the
                        earnings can be significant.</p>
                    <h3 id="89">89. SAAS Developer</h3>
                    <p>If phone apps aren’t really your thing, try developing SAAS (Software as a
                        Service) instead. SAAS is a type of software that performs a specific
                        function for the individual, such as Dropbox and GoogleApps. It’s even more
                        difficult than developing a phone app and you’ll need a big idea rather than
                        a novelty gimmick, but the payoff is also greater.</p>
                    <h3 id="90">90. WordPress Theme Developer</h3>
                    <p>If you want to start out with a smaller project before you create a new app
                        or SAAS, try making a WordPress theme instead. New blogs and companies are
                        constantly creating new WordPress websites and they all need themes, so
                        there’s a huge potential customer base. You can choose to release a free
                        theme but make people pay extra for customizable features (with the hope
                        they will) or a paid theme with customizable features included. If lots of
                        people download your theme, it all starts to add up.</p>
                    <h3 id="91">91. Therapist</h3>
                    <p>Everyone knows that therapy is a highly-skilled and difficult profession, but
                        not many people realize it’s moving online. If you’re a counselor, clinical
                        psychologist or therapist that would prefer to work in their own home
                        instead of a clinical setting or you’d just like to take on some extra gigs,
                        you could be in luck. Websites like <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/"
                                                               target="_blank"
                                                               rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">BetterHelp</a>
                        and <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/" target="_blank"
                               rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">TalkSpace</a> are revolutionizing
                        the area by providing therapy appointments that take place entirely
                        digitally by texting or video calls.</p>
                    <h3 id="92">92. Wedding Planning</h3>
                    <p>Wedding planning is one of those jobs plenty of people dream of and others
                        would find horrendous. Do you fit into the first category? It might not be
                        as difficult as you think to make your dream a reality. Wedding planning
                        doesn’t require any kind of official qualification and success mostly comes
                        down to experience – so, if you’ve planned your own wedding, you already
                        have experience. Leverage your network by letting past guests know you’re
                        planning on starting your own business (assuming your wedding was reasonably
                        recent), and see if anybody takes you up on the offer.</p>
                    <h3 id="93">93. Be a Trainer for a Specific Sport</h3>
                    <p>We all know that personal trainers are in high demand, but unless you’re a
                        ripped gym bunny, it’s probably not a career option you’ve considered
                        yourself. Yet sports coaching isn’t limited to this kind of standard fitness
                        training; you could also coach for other sports, like golf or hockey. You
                        might be more qualified than you realize if you’ve been playing a sport
                        since your childhood, and there’s a big market for improving sport amongst
                        children and their parents.</p>
                    <h3 id="94">94. Event DJ</h3>
                    <p>Not many people have a full DJ set lying around in the house, never mind know
                        how to use one; if you’re one of the few that can tick both of those boxes,
                        you probably already get regularly asked to DJ for parties free of charge.
                        With just a touch of extra confidence, you could take that to the next level
                        by charging for your services. You could start small with local weddings
                        then build up to club nights or other big events. Also, if you love music,

                        give you free products in return for your time. However, there are a few
                        sites that offer gift cards or money, such as <a

                        websites</a> rather than products. It might sound daunting if you’re not
                        much of a technical whizz, but companies often prefer to recruit people who
                        don’t feel as confident with technology since they represent a significant
                        proportion of internet users. <a

                    <p>Search engine evaluation requires slightly more technical knowledge than
                        website testing; you’ll need to be able to understand how search engines
                        work. The website will give you some keywords to search for and you’ll have
                        to be able to evaluate the results. Because the work is slightly more
                        difficult, the pay is usually quite good. Some sites that frequently have
                        openings for search engine evaluators are Appen, Lionbridge, and

                        there’s no guarantee you’ll get chosen, and you’ll need to be a US citizen

                    <h3 id="99">99. Medical Transcription</h3>
                    <p>To make more money from transcription, it helps to choose a specialized area
                        to build a career from. One profitable niche is medical transcription.
                        However, you’ll need a certificate approved by the Association for
                        Healthcare Documentation Integrity to get started if you’re from the
                        USA.</p>
                    <h3 id="100">100. Spend Time on Your Smartphone</h3>
                    <p>Normally, spending time on your smartphone means more time wasted and less
                        money earned – but it’s actually possible to get paid for scrolling
                        aimlessly through your phone. The Nielsen Digital App lets you earn points
                        for every hour you spend on your smartphone and get entered into sweepstakes
                        too. Unsurprisingly, this comes in return for extracting data about your
                        phone use habits.</p>
                    <h3 id="101">101. Sell Gift Cards You Won’t Use</h3>
                    <p>We all get gift cards for birthdays, Christmas or prize draws, but they’re
                        not always from our shop of choice. Instead of letting them sit in your
                        wallet until they reach their expiration date, why not cash in? <a

                        invited to fill in surveys, and depending on your answers you may be invited
                        to a focus group. Pay can be very high if you fit the right demographic,

                    <h3 id="104">104. Clinical Trials</h3>
                    <p>Taking part in a clinical trial might not sound very appealing, but it’s
                        certainly profitable – you can earn thousands of dollars for a few weeks for
                        doing nothing at all. There’s not as much risk as you might think since,
                        once a product reaches the clinical trial stage, it’s already passed
                        multiple tests and is unlikely to be dangerous. But don’t just go in
                        blindly: make sure you do your research about what the medicine being tested
                        is. <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank"
                               rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> has a
                        database of thousands of trials; once you register your interest, you’ll
                        need to attend a screening to ensure you’re a healthy candidate.</p>
                    <h3 id="105">105. Become a Mystery Shopper</h3>
                    <p>Mystery shoppers go to stores with a ‘secret mission’ to extract data whilst
                        posing as normal shoppers. For example, they might go to a car dealer and
                        take a test drive under the guise of wanting to purchase a car, when in
                        reality they’re collecting information about the sales process. Pretending
                        to buy goods might sound easy enough, but it can be uncomfortable; mystery
                        shoppers are often asked to pose as difficult customers to see how customer
                        service staff react. Be careful of scams when looking for work as a mystery
                        shopper – amongst the companies you can trust are <a

                        Amazon and Walmart.</p>
                    <h3 id="107">107. Play Games for Money</h3>
                    <p>Earning money just from playing games sounds like a gamer’s paradise. The
                        dream doesn’t always live up to its expectations; generally, companies that
                        offer money in return for gaming make you test out new games that might be
                        boring or glitchy. However, <a href="https://www.mistplay.com/"

                    <h3 id="108">108. Open Up Your Mailbox</h3>
                    <p>There are lots of ways to make money if you’re prepared to let third parties
                        access your personal data. One of them is <a
                                href="http://www.sbkcenter.com/consumer.html" target="_blank"

                            Center</a>, a market research company that will pay you to have a peek

                        to $20 every 6-10 weeks.</p>
                    <h3 id="109">109. Make a Bet on Yourself Losing Weight</h3>
                    <p>It sounds ridiculous, but it’s possible to make money from making a bet to an
                        app that you’ll be able to reach a certain weight within a certain period.
                        <a href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/healthywage/" target="_blank"
                           rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">HealthyWage</a> is a health

                        you can win up to $10,000. It’s certainly not for everyone, but it would be
                        rude not to mention it.</p>
                    <h3 id="110">110. Look for Job Adverts</h3>
                    <p>Job adverts can help you make money even if you don’t apply. How? Indeed’s
                        offshoot <a href="https://jobspotter.indeed.com/" target="_blank"
                                    rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Job Spotter</a> incentivizes
                        smartphone users to snap photos of job adverts they pass and submit them to
                        the site. You won’t be able to claim cash for your efforts, but you will be
                        able to earn points towards gift cards.</p>
                    <h3 id="111">111. Make Money from Referrals</h3>
                    <p>No matter how many referral offers you find, when you really need them you
                        can never remember which companies had the offers. The <a
                                href="https://chumsreferral.com/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Chums</a> app solves this problem
                        by listing all the companies currently offering gift cards, discounts or
                        money for referring friends; you can then team up with a ‘chum’ and both
                        benefit from the offer.</p>
                    <h3 id="112">112. Film Videos of Yourself Shopping</h3>
                    <p>As long as showing your face in videos doesn’t bother you, you could make
                        some money by signing up for <a href="https://producttube.com/"

                            Tube</a>, which works similarly to survey websites except they extract
                        consumer opinions from the videos instead. The films you have to record
                        could include reviews in your home or the shopping experience in a
                        supermarket. The app claims that you can earn $50-80 worth of gift cards per
                        hour of effort, which is a lot more than survey websites.</p>
                    <h3 id="113">113. Take a Test Drive</h3>
                    <p>You can often earn $50 or $100 worth of gift cards just by taking a test
                        drive. The hardest part about earning the money is figuring out which car
                        manufacturers are currently offering the promotion. Just check the websites
                        of car companies and look for a special promotions tab; this should let you
                        know if there are any test drive offers.</p>
                    <h3 id="114">114. Use a Cashback App</h3>
                    <p>There’s nothing quite as satisfying as applying a coupon that saves you a ton
                        of money or earning cashback points for a shop. It’s also easier than ever
                        to achieve now that the days of cutting out coupons from newspapers are long
                        gone. <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/wikibuy-review/">Capital One
                            Shopping</a> is a website and app that lets you search for relevant on
                        the go, so you can check if the store you’re visiting has any promotions you
                        can apply. Other popular apps are <a
                                href="https://millennialmoney.com/rakuten-review/">Rakuten</a> and
                        <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/ibotta-review/">Ibotta</a>, which lets
                        you earn cashback either from scanning receipts or shopping online.</p>
                    <h3 id="115">115. Negotiate Your Bill Prices</h3>
                    <p>Most of us are paying more than we should be for our bills; when energy
                        companies lower their prices or offer new deals for new customers, their
                        existing customers are left still paying the older prices. Even if we’re not
                        being duped by our power company, there might be a competitor offering a
                        lower price that we’re not taking advantage of. You could solve this problem
                        manually by regularly checking how much you’re paying, but this is a serious
                        time investment. If you’d rather outsource the work, <a
                                href="https://go.millennialmoney.com/truebill/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer sponsored">Truebill</a> will do it
                        for you at the price of taking a commission from the savings you make.</p>
                    <h3 id="116">116. Check Your Credit Score</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://millennialmoney.com/how-to-improve-credit-score/">Improving
                        your credit score</a> doesn’t seem like an obvious way to make money, but
                        the truth is a bad credit can cost you in unexpected ways. It might mean
                        you’re given a higher interest rate for a loan or that you’re unable to
                        obtain a mortgage so you have to rent for longer instead. So take action and
                        check your credit score on a website like <a

                        there a few banks that offer over 1.50% interest APY. These include CIT Bank
                        and Marcus by Goldman Sachs.</p>

                    <p>High-yield savings accounts are preferable to their low-yield equivalent, but
                        better still is an investment account; this could bring your returns up to
                        around an 8-10% average over long periods. Two of the top providers are
                        Fidelity and Vanguard; the investment management service you ultimately
                        choose depends on your needs. Fidelity is a great option for <a
                                href="https://millennialmoney.com/start-investing/">new
                            investors</a> who want to learn about how to invest, whilst Vanguard is

                    <p><a href="https://millennialmoney.com/ally-invest/">Ally</a> is also a solid
                        choice. Whether you’re a new investor, an experienced trader or somewhere in
                        between, Ally offers investment choices with some of the lowest commissions
                        in the industry.</p>

                    <h2 id="now">How Can I Make Money Right Now?</h2>
                    <p>There are hundreds of ways to make money eventually, but your options narrow
                        down if you need that cash in your pocket immediately. Don’t despair – it
                        might be harder, but it’s certainly not impossible.</p>
                    <p>Many people have thousands of dollars’ worth of unused possessions in their
                        homes, so selling some of this on eBay or other eCommerce sites could take
                        you a long way. The advantage of eBay is that you’ll receive the money in
                        your PayPal account as soon as you’re paid, so you really will receive money
                        right now.</p>
                    <p>You can also make money straightaway by completing surveys, microtasks,
                        rewards programs, or any of the other simple suggestions on this list. The
                        amount you’ll get won’t be high, but it will be instant.</p>
                    <h2 id="day">How Can I Make $100 A Day?</h2>
                    <p>You’re never going to <a

                        $100</a> a day completing surveys and microtasks, but many of the jobs on
                        this list have the potential to make this much – some will even give you
                        $100 an hour!</p>
                    <p>If you choose one of the more skilled job options, such as freelance
                        proofreading or being a virtual assistant, it won’t take you long to reach
                        the point when you’re earning $100 a day. If you fall short, you can always
                        top up the amount with a passive income source or low-value tasks.</p>
                    <p>If you want to make as much a day as possible, it’s important to set up
                        multiple income streams, so you’re not relying on one source of money alone;
                        if it dries up, you’ll instantly plummet from $100 to $0.</p>
                    <h2 id="job">How To Make Money Without a Job</h2>

                        to make money. You can earn from renting just about anything – your car,
                        your spare room, and even your old baby equipment.</p>
                    <p>You can also find casual work online to suit your schedule and needs. Data
                        entry work, microtasks, and even English teaching are accessible to everyone
                        and can be easily performed at home if you have a laptop and internet
                        connection.</p>
                    <h2 id="creative">Find Creative Ways To Make Money</h2>
                    <p>There’s <a href="https://millennialmoney.com/money-management/">no excuse for
                        running out of money</a> anymore. Well, we all mess up sometimes, but
                        there’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to conjure up a few hundred dollars
                        out of thin air if you’re prepared to get creative about how to make money.
                    </p>
                    <p>Don’t get disheartened if the amounts coming in seem minuscule at first. The
                        internet might be miraculous for all the earning possibilities it’s brought
                        us, but that doesn’t mean the money will fall on your lap without you having
                        to work for it.</p>
                    <p>The most painful part of the process is deciding which money-making methods
                        you’re going to choose and figuring out how to get the maximum benefit out
                        of them. Once you build up a reputation and know how things work, it will
                        get easier.</p></body>

                                            <p>I’m not sure if it’s intentional or an editorial
                                                comment, but the pitch for blogging says “Is there a
                                                subject or topic you’re extremely knowledgeable
                                                about and enjoy enough to be able to write on it
                                                every day for years? If the answer to this question
                                                is yes, then starting a blog could be right for you.
                                                It’s a slow journey to build up regular visitors and
                                                readers, but once you do it’s impossible to make
                                                significant sums of money.”. Doesn’t come across as
                                                much of an endorsement.</p>
